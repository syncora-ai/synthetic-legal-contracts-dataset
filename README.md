# Synthetic Legal Contract Dataset â€” Powered by Syncora  

High-Fidelity **Synthetic Dataset** for LLM Training, Legal NLP & AI Research  

---

## About This Dataset  

This repository provides a **synthetic dataset** of legal contract Q&A interactions, modeled after real-world corporate filings (e.g., SEC 8-K disclosures). The data is generated using **Syncora.ai**, ensuring **privacy-safe, fake data** that is safe to use in **LLM training, benchmarking, and experimentation**.  

This **free dataset** captures the style and structure of legal exchanges without exposing any confidential or sensitive client information.  

## ðŸ“¦ What This Repo Contains  

- **Synthetic Legal Contract Dataset** â€“ JSONL format, ready for **LLM training**.

## ðŸš¨ Simulated Regulatory Scenarios

This synthetic legal dataset is not just for LLM training â€” it enables developers and researchers to create **simulated regulatory scenarios**. Examples include:

- Detecting high-risk clauses in contracts before real-world deployment  
- Testing AI models on rare or edge-case compliance situations  
- Simulating SEC filings and corporate disclosures to evaluate NLP models  
- Benchmarking contract analysis tools safely without exposing sensitive data  

This section gives the dataset a **practical, standout value**, showing it can be used for **stress-testing AI in legal environments**.
